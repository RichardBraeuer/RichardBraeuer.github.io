My research focus is on the drivers of firm innovation and its long term productivity effect. I use microeconometrics to study the firm’s innovation decision and general equilibrium models to understand its macroeconomic impact.

I am honored to be part of the research project „Long Term Effects of Privatization in Eastern Germany“, founded through the Max-Planck Research Award 2019.

Previously, I was part of the scientific staff of the Competitiveness Research Network (CompNet), which gathers detailed data on the European Economy using a distributed micro moments approach.

I have worked as a teaching assistant at the Tinbergen Institute in Amsterdam and given workshops on firm micro data as part of the CompNet initiative, e.g. at the European Commission.
