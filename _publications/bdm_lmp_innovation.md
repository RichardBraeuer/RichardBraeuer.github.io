excerpt: 'This paper examines how labor market power shapes firms’ decisions to innovate and growth.
We develop an endogenous growth model where firms optimize R&D spending to increase
their future productivity while facing an upward-sloping labor supply curve, generating
monopsony power. This creates two opposing distortions: (1) monopsonistic firms have
stronger incentives to innovate and grow as they enjoy larger profits, but (2) firm growth
increases (infra-)marginal labor costs by pushing firms up the labor supply curve, which
reduces the returns to productivity-enhancing innovation. Theoretically, the first effect dominates
for small firms, while the second is stronger for large firms. We test these predictions
using rich firm-level data from the German manufacturing sector (1995–2018) to estimate
firms’ productivity and labor market power. Empirically, we find that, conditional on size,
labor market power negatively correlates with R&D investment. Small (large) firms in highmonopsony-
power regions exhibit relatively high (low) R&D spending, compared to competitive
labor markets, which aligns with our model predictions. When combining our model
with the data, we find that the distortinary impact of labor market power on firms’ innovation
choices has a sizeable negative effect on aggregate productivity and can explain a substantial
share of regional productivity differences in the German manufacturing sector.'
