excerpt: 'This paper studies the effect of labor market power (LMP) on firms` innovation decisions and consequently its effect on aggregate growth. We find that LMP is particularly prevalent in structurally weak regions across Europe and is negatively correlated to aggregate productivity and innovation activity. We study the effect of LMP with a firm level data set on the German manufacturing sector 1999-2016. We estimate firms` labor market power, the effect on innovation on productivity and profits. Then we estimate the value of additional innovation for firms in the poorer, labor-market-power-prone East German states and in West Germany. The average firm in the East German states gains between 0.3 and 0.7 Million \euro more from innovation than its equivalent in West Germany. This relationship is reversed for low productivity firms: Low productivity East German firms gain about 1.5 Million \euro more, since innovation allows them to grow to a moderate size and profit from the high labor market power environment. Statically, a one standard deviation change in LMP explains a differential of 10\% of firm-level R\&D spending. As a result, Eastern firms are less productive, smaller, but not necessarily less profitable. Our theoretical framework provides an explanation for these patterns: Firms with high labor market power have less incentives to innovate as their profit function depends to a relatively lesser extent on total factor productivity (TFP). With this new channel and its implication on firm dynamics we provide a new explanation for the persistence of low productivity in structurally weak regions and in particular for the persistence of the productivity gap within Germany.'
