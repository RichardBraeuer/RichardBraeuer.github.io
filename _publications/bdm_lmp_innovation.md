excerpt: 'We document that firms possess high labor market power (LMP) across structurally weak
European regions. We study the effect of LMP on firmsâ€™ innovation decisions and aggregate
growth. Theoretically, LMP has a nonlinear relationship with R&D: Higher profits incentivize
entry and innovation of very small firms, but medium and large firms are disincentivized to
innovate, since they have to pay higher wages if they grow further. To test this prediction
empirically, we estimate LMP across German manufacturing firms and replicate the predicted
innovation pattern. High and low LMP firms behave similarly after controlling for LMP. We
build an endogenous growth model to understand the size of this effect relative to the overall
innovation and productivity gap between East and West Germany'
