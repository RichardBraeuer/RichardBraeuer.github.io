excerpt: 'How important is creative destruction for economic growth? We address
this question investigating economic productivity and firm dynamics in planned
economies where the role of Schumpeterian forces is restricted by design. Us-
ing novel industrial-firm-level data from Soviet Russia and East Germany in
the late 1970s and 1980s, we compare these economies against their market
counterparts such as the US and West Germany. We document little response
to productivity changes, with few firms entering or exiting in the former com-
munist countries. Through counterfactual simulations, we conclude that en-
hancing responsiveness to productivity shocks and increasing the rates of en-
try and exit to the US levels could have boosted growth by about 2.3% per
year. This increase in growth would have covered the larger part of the eco-
nomic gap between Eastern European and Western economies observed in the
last decade before the fall of the Iron Curtain.'
