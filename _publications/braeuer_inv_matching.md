excerpt: 'I analyze the matching of firms and inventors and the patent (citation) arrival rate of the resulting matches as a potential driver of slowing technology growth. I document a global trend towards increased assortative matching and declining inventor mobility to low productivity firms despite a largely constant patent invention function. To arrive at these results, I further develop empirical strategies used in the search and matching labor market literature to account for inventor teams and adapt these estimators to the pecularities of the PATSTAT patent data from 1974-2012, which I use as an employer-employee data set.'
