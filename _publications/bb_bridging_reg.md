title: "GMM over Split Data Sets"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/bb_bridging_reg
excerpt: 'We present an algorithm for linear GMM estimation which works
even if the researcher cannot combine the underlying data into one
data set. We discuss three different applications: First, a regression
where X- and Y- variables are in different data sets. Second a regression
where observations are in different data sets. Third, a regression
where the complete data is so large as to be unwieldy. We demonstrate
these use cases by studying the effects of German R&D subsidies
without merging patent and firm data, estimating a Europe-wide
production function without merging the firm level data sets of different
EU countries and by documenting the speed performance of our
code in simulated data. The main requirement of this method is that
instruments and exogenous regressors have to be present in all data
sets.'
