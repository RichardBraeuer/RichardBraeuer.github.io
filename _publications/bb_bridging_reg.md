title: "When Aggregation is Necessary, is it Necessarily Bad?"

collection: publications

category: ongoing

permalink: /publication/bb_bridging_reg

excerpt: 'This paper explores microeconometric inference when the required
variables and/or observations are stored in siloed datasts that cannot
be combined. Proposals for estimation strategies are given for different
cases, depending on the (in)ability to stack observations from multiple
micro-level datasets or merge variables at the micro level across
datasets. In all our proposed research strategies, some level of aggregation
is necessary in order to stack micro-aggregated observations
and/or merge the variables at a less granular level. We discuss examples
of our methods using actual and simulated datasets, in light of
the Grunfeld and Griliches (1960) paper, ’Is Aggregation Necessarily
Bad’.'
