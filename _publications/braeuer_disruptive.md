excerpt: 'This paper proposes to explain the productivity growth slowdown with firms consciously preventing disruptive innovation. I build an endogenous growth model with incremental and disruptive inventions and an inventor labor market where firms poach disruptive inventors to protect established technologies. I calibrate this model to the global patent landscape in 1990 and show that it predicts 52% of the decline of disruptive innovation until 2010. I confirm critical assumptions with an event study: Disruptions increase future research productivity, hurt incumbent inventors and raise the probability of future disruption. Without disruption, technology classes trend further towards incrementalism. '
